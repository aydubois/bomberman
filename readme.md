You are the player at the top left of the board. Your goal is to be the last survivor. You must eliminate your opponent(s) by planting bombs. Some walls can disappear thanks to bombs and can hide bonuses. \
\
## How to play?\
First of all you must register to be able to play (the goal is to keep your score. _Functionality in a future update_)\
Use the arrows to move around and the escape bar to place bombs.\

### Clarification on 'AI'
Only the ia2.js file is used. The other ia.js files are tests, so is the AI folder.\
The game is still under construction. Algorithms are not yet "perfect".\
